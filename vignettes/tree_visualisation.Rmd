Using Roma, a user can easily obtain a taxonomic tree of interest using the getTaxonomy structure. The tree can be restricted to a certain root or by a list of members and the data is returned in the newick format. The newick can then be exported and used to create a tree object using ape which can then be visualised using ggtree.

Below is the example code on how to get a simple visualisation of the tree rooted at the Alveolata taxonomic level.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(roma)

taxonomy = getTaxonomy(root="Alveolata")

write.table(taxonomy$newick, "newick.txt")

tree_object = getTree("newick.txt")

ggtree::ggtree(tree_object)


```

This tree can be further analysed and annotated using the ggtree package available in Bioconductor.
